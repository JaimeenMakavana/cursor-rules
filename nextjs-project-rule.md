# Next.js Architecture Rules (Senior / Architect Level)

These rules define **non-negotiable architectural principles** for this Next.js codebase. They are written for experienced developers and architects. They assume fluency in React, modern JavaScript/TypeScript, and web platform fundamentals.

The goal is **long-term scalability, correctness, and operational clarity**, not developer convenience or tutorial-style patterns.

---

## 1. Architectural Philosophy

* This is a **product-grade system**, not a demo or experiment.
* Prefer **boring, explicit, and predictable** designs over clever abstractions.
* Optimize for:

  * Change isolation
  * Testability
  * Observability
  * Failure containment

Avoid patterns that trade short-term velocity for long-term entropy.

---

## 2. App Router Is the Default

* Use the **Next.js App Router** exclusively unless explicitly justified otherwise.
* Pages Router is considered legacy and must not be introduced.

Key implications:

* Server Components are the default
* Client Components are opt-in and treated as a boundary

---

## 3. Server vs Client Boundary Discipline

### Server Components

* Contain:

  * Data fetching
  * Authorization decisions
  * Feature gating
  * Layout composition
* Must remain **pure and side-effect free** (no browser APIs).

### Client Components

* Used only for:

  * User interaction
  * Browser-only APIs
  * Local ephemeral state
* Must be **explicitly marked** with `"use client"`
* Should never fetch core domain data directly

> If a component does not require browser APIs, it must not be a Client Component.

---

## 4. Data Access Architecture

* Data fetching is a **server concern**.
* Never call databases, internal services, or secrets from Client Components.

Recommended structure:

* `src/domain/` → business logic, entities, invariants
* `src/infrastructure/` → DB, external APIs, adapters
* `src/application/` → orchestration, use-cases
* `src/app/` → delivery layer (routing, layouts, RSC composition)

React components must not contain domain rules.

---

## 5. API Routes Are Integration Boundaries

* Route handlers (`app/api/**/route.ts`) are:

  * Integration points
  * Not business logic containers

Rules:

* Validate input explicitly
* Call application-layer use cases
* Return normalized error contracts

Never embed business rules directly in route handlers.

---

## 6. State Management Strategy

* Prefer **server state** over client state.
* URL state is preferred over global client stores.

Client state libraries (Zustand, Redux, etc.):

* Require architectural justification
* Must be scoped, not global by default

If state must survive reloads, question the architecture.

---

## 7. Side Effects and Mutations

* All mutations must be:

  * Explicit
  * Auditable
  * Idempotent where possible

Use:

* Server Actions for mutations
* Clear command-style naming (`createOrder`, `cancelSubscription`)

Avoid implicit side effects hidden inside components.

---

## 8. Error Handling and Failure Modes

* Errors are part of system behavior, not edge cases.

Rules:

* Use `error.tsx` and `not-found.tsx` intentionally
* Never swallow errors
* Distinguish:

  * User errors
  * System errors
  * Integration failures

Design for partial failure.

---

## 9. Performance Is Architectural, Not Cosmetic

* Rendering strategy (SSR, SSG, streaming) must be intentional.
* Do not rely on memoization as a primary optimization.

Rules:

* Measure before optimizing
* Avoid unnecessary client-side hydration
* Treat bundle size as a first-class constraint

---

## 10. Testing Philosophy

* Test behavior, not implementation.
* Unit tests target domain and application layers.
* Integration tests validate Next.js routing and data boundaries.

Do not snapshot-test React trees without strong justification.

---

## 11. Dependency Governance

* Every new dependency is an architectural decision.

Rules:

* Prefer platform and framework primitives
* Avoid overlapping libraries
* Justify any state, data, or form library

Smaller dependency graphs are easier to reason about and secure.

---

## 12. Code Review Bar

Every change must answer:

* What boundary does this respect or introduce?
* What future change does this make easier?
* What failure mode does this handle explicitly?

If these answers are unclear, the change is not ready.

---

## Final Principle

> Architecture exists to make **the right things easy and the wrong things hard**.

If this codebase feels permissive, unclear, or magical, the architecture has failed.
